# adjustVideo2FitAudio
Hi, this is muyu. The idea of adjusting the video(trim the video) to match the length of audio comes up during my intern in Translai(Transflow).<hr>
Basically, here is the problem: the length of video doesn't match the length of audio but we want to mix them, specifically to trim the video to match the audio. eg. One Chinese video is planned to fit a tts(English) audio the length of which does not match the video, and finally the video will be dubbed with the English audio.

**By speeding up or slowing down the slicent part of video to control the length!**.
