# adjustVideo2FitAudio
Hi, this is muyu. The idea of adjusting the video(trim the video) to match the length of audio comes up during my intern in Translai(Transflow).<hr>
Basically, here is the problem: the length of video doesn't match the length of audio but we want to mix them, specifically to trim the video to match the audio.
